# GNU screen configuration.
# 
# Unfamiliar?  GNU screen is basically a terminal-based terminal emulator.  It allows you to do things like have tabs (across platforms), but also leave your session up if you're not connected (e.g., on a server).  You can also share a terminal session with another user.

# use the caption line for the computer name, load, hstatus (as set by zsh), & time
# the caption line gets repeated for each window being displayed (using :split),
# so we'll use color cues to differentiate the caption of the current, active
# window, and the others.
#    always                  - display the caption continuously.  Since
#                              hardstatus is 'alwayslastline', it will be on the
#                              next to last line.

#                              NOTE: omitting the '0' before the '24' would pad
#                              or truncate the text so it would be 24% from the
#                              right.
